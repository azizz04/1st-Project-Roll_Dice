# 1st-Project-Roll_Dice
In the begginig I did use python becuase it is easy to handle and relate,
Secondly what I use? I did use some easy codes to make this game wich called "Roll Dice", 
About the game it is two dices when you press roll it will roll the two dices 
And the result will be ahead of you and you can play it more than once 'unlimited' 
That`s all about the game, I hope it will be a nice game.
